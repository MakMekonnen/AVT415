    <h1> Project 1: Checkpoint 1</h1>
    <h2> Topic 1: Cameras </h2>
    <p>
        Cameras have gone a long way from chemical reactions between salts and light sensitive coating like Bitumen,
        to light reacting to light sensitive film,
        to the modern era of camera sensors of capturing light before converting it to eletrical charges making it digital.
        Cameras and photography has existed long since the 17th century and has gotten better with every scientific and technological advancement.

    <h2> Topic 2: Animation </h2>
    <p>
        Animation in it's most technical definition is the process of creating movement from still images, much like film.
        But the difference is that film records reality and animation shows the imagination and the skill of its artists.
        The actual technicality of animation has not changed much, or really the skills required to create animation, but instead different techniques made it easier to create the juggernaut we have now.

    <h2> Topic 3: Why Adobe is just bad. </h2>
    <p>
        Adobe is one of the most hated software companies for a reason. Between its (alleged) illegal, according to the FTC, subscription method that is already extremely expensive,
        its software that is buggy, crashes often, and just mind-numbingly rage inducing. It has somehow maintained industry standard position. But thankfully some software is losing market share.
        Just recently, Adobe XD was shut down, after failing to acquire Figma.
